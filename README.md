Golf Tee Time
=============

Welcome to the Golf Tee Time app.  This was a collaborative effort by myself, Ryan Goodhew and Kiefer Johnson.  It was our mid-term project for our 8-week Web Development Boot Camp by Lighthouse Labs

The application is installed on Heroku here:
https://teetimelhl.herokuapp.com/

The app has no connection to any real golf courses of course, it is merely here for demostration purposes. 


Usage:
  . Select the 'Book Now' button or link. 
  . Select the desired date you wish to play a game of golf, and the number of players in your party.  Click 'Submit'.
  . The available tee times for that date will have a green 'Book' button beside them, other days with a number are the current bookings that are taken and the number of people in that party.
  . After selecting an open tee time, an enter email box will appear.  Input your email address and click 'Submit'
  . If you have previously used the app and booked a tee time before, an info confirmation box will appear.
  . If you have never registered on this site before, the fields will be empty and you will need to enter your full name and phone number, (your email address will have carried over from the previous page) to continue.
  . Select 'Confirm Booking' to make the tee time reservation, or click 'Cancel' and return to the home page.
